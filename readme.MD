# Random number generator web app

[Live Demo](https://randice.vercel.app/)

## Introduction

There are various use cases for a Random Number Generator. You could do a random dice roll or get a random quote. Most of the time, the implementation is relatively straightforward and similar to this project’s approach. In this project, we will create a dice roll simulation.

## Requirements

The RNG should consist of:

-   An input box to assign how many dice to roll
-   A drop down box to select the sides of the dice (for example d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)
-   A JavaScript `Math.random()` function taking the inputs from the form
-   An output to show # of dice rolled, the type of dice (d4, d6, etc), the total count of the dices rolled
-   Output the details (number) of the individual dice rolls (Possibly using a foreach loop)

## Suggested Implementation

-   Basic JavaScript knowledge of using variables and event listeners.
-   Using simple JavaScript functions such as `Math.random()`
-   Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS to create forms

## References

-   This project requires very few resources that are all freely available and easy to set up.
-   For anyone wishing to brush up on their design skills, you can use CSS to change the look of the form.
-   For those who use or want to understand Bootstrap, you can use the library for the elements you need.

## Getting Started

### 0. Set up your environment

If you're just getting started with coding, below are a few recommended items for general setup. Feel free to skip this part if you're all set up.

-   Choose & install a code editor (Suggest: VSCode, Atom, Sublime Text)
-   Install terminal
-   Install Git for version control & sign up for GitHub for version control hosting

### 1. Create GitHub repository

We require a GitHub public repository for every solution. This way it's easier to share your code with the community if you need help. When you share your solution, your repo will need to be public, but feel free to start off private if you prefer that.

### 2. Build your project

Below is a suggested process, but feel free to use any workflow that works best for you.

**Review project requirements**

Read the project requirementsto plan how you will tackle the project

**Not sure how to plan your project?**

-   Look at similar projects

    There are usually many similar projects available online, especially in the open-source community. You can also reference existing websites that have similar functionality. We also have solutions to this project shared by other members of the DevProjects community for you to learn from.

    Other people's projects and code can be great resources when you're just starting out. You can use them as a way to anticipate potential problems you might encounter as you build your project. Feel free to use their solution as a starting point if you're stuck.

-   List and prioritize the features for your project

    Begin by understanding the dependencies between features as one feature may depend on another. We recommend starting with the feature with the most dependencies. Optionally, you can ask yourself questions such as Does my website/app make sense if I don't include this feature? Do I have to implement feature A before feature B?

-   Choose the framework and library you want to use

    Take a look at the list of suggested languages and frameworks in the Project tab, along with documentation and references. If you're not sure how to choose, check out the State of JS survey. It ranks front-end frameworks based on factors such as usage and awareness. This should help you understand the available options and which framework to pick for your project. Don't worry if you have no experience with using frameworks! We encourage you to try one and start from there — you'll get a better understanding of frameworks as you work with them more.

    If this is your first time building a front-end project, one option is to start without a framework so you gain a better understanding of the fundamentals of a website first (i.e. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

-   Estimate project timeline

    Although there is no deadline for this project, we still encourage you to estimate how long you will need to complete this project in order to help you track your progress. This is good practice for when you're working for clients or in a team.

-   Reference official documentation

    As you plan and build your project, it's good to get into the habit of looking up official documentation before asking others for help.

**Get your hands dirty**

It's time to start writing your code! Keep in mind that your code will be read by others.

We recommend following Clean Code principles and code review best practices. Common questions developers ask during a code review:

-   **Functionality**: Does the code behave as the author likely intended?
-   **Naming**: Did the developer choose clear names for variables, classes, methods, etc.?
-   **Tests**: Does the code have correct and well-designed automated tests?
-   **Simplicity**: Is the code in its simplest form? Would another developer be able to easily understand this code?
-   **Style**: Does the code have consistent style? Is it easy to understand?
